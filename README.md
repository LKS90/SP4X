#SP4X

This is just a little project to generate a world
using [Kenneys Game Assets](http://www.kenney.nl/)
and [Unity](http://unity3d.com/).

Still WIP, but I like to work from different places.

Software used for this project:  
- Unity 5
- Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio 2013/2015
- Visula Studio 2013/2015 Tools for Unity

If you use any of those porograms to edit, only
relevant files will be saved.
